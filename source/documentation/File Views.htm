<p align="left" class="PageCaption">The File and Folder views</p>
<p class="MidCaption"><a name="remote"></a>1. The remote site</p>
<p class="bodyText">The file and folder view of the remote site is located on
the right side of the main window. With it you can navigate on an FTP server and
initiate downloads.</p>
<p class="bodyText" align="center"><img border="0" src="fileview_remote.png" width="445" height="306"></p>

<p class="SmallCaption" align="left">The file and folder list</p>

<p class="bodyText" align="left">Each line represents a file or folder. The file
and folder icons help you to identify the files and folders quickly. The labels
above each column describe their meaning. The meaning of the first 4 columns
should be clear: Filename, Filesize, Date and Time. The last column entitled
&quot;Permissions&quot; tells you what access rights you have on the files. You don't
really have to care about the permissions. The first character indicates whether
the entry is a file, a directory or a link. The last characters are three groups
of three characters each. The first group describes the owner rights, the second
the group rights and the last one the public rights. An r means that you have
read access, w means write access and x means the right to execute a file. You
can sort the list by clicking on one of the column labels. A small gray arrow
indicates which column the list is sorted on and the sort direction. You can toggle the sort direction by clicking the heading again.</p>
<p class="bodyText" align="left">You can change the style of the list and the
visible columns with the <a href="Menus%20and%20Toolbars.htm#menu">menu of the
main window</a>.</p>
<p class="SmallCaption" align="left">Navigating on the server</p>

<p class="bodyText" align="left">On the upper side you will notice the combo
box. Here the current folder is listed. You can also enter a new folder. Press
enter and FileZilla switches to this folder. You can also click on the arrow on
the right to open a popup menu containing a list of all directories you've
visited on that server. Click on an item to switch to that directory.</p>
<p class="bodyText" align="center"><img border="0" src="fileview_combo.png" width="254" height="60"></p>
<p class="bodyText" align="left">Below that is the file and folder list. The
first entry in the list is always &quot;..&quot;. It represents the parent
folder of the current folder. You can switch to a folder by double clicking it
or by using the context menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="SmallCaption" align="left">Downloading files</p>
<p class="bodyText" align="left">There are three ways to download a file: You can
double click it, you can use the context menu or you can drag and drop the file
into the local file list. You can operate on a folder in the same way. You may
also select multiple files and folders for transfer in one operation, except of
course double-clicking is not available in this situation. To add items to the
queue for a later transfer, you may again use the context menu or you can drag
and drop them into the queue.</p>
<p class="SmallCaption" align="left">The context menu</p>
<p class="bodyText" align="left">Right-click the file and folder list to display
the context menu.</p>
