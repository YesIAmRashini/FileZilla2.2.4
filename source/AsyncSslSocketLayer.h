------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

CAsyncSslSocketLayer is a layer class for CAsyncSocketEx which allows you to establish SSL secured
connections to servers.

How to use
----------

Using this class is really simple. In the easiest case, just add an instance of
CAsyncSslSocketLayer to your socket and call InitClientSsl after creation of the socket.

This class only has three new public functions:
- InitClientSsl();
  This functions establishes an SSL connection to the server. You can call it at any
  time one the socket has been created.
  Most likely you want to call this function right after calling Create for the socket.
  But sometimes, you'll need to call this function later. One example is for an FTP connection
  with explicit SSL: In this case you would have to call InitClientSsl after receiving the reply
  to an 'AUTH SSL' command.
- Is UsingSSL();
  Returns true if you've previously called InitClientSsl()
- SetNotifyReply(SetNotifyReply(int nID, int nCode, int result);
  You can call this function only after receiving a layerspecific callback with the SSL_VERIFY_CERT 
  id. See below for details.

This layer sends some layerspecific notifications to your socket instance, you can handle them in
OnLayerCallback of your socket class.
Valid notification IDs are:
- SSL_INFO 0
  There are two possible values for param2:
	SSL_INFO_ESTABLISHED 0 - You'll get this notification if the SSL negotiation was successful
	SSL_INFO_SHUTDOWNCOMPLETE 1 - You'll get this notification if the SSL connection has been shut 
                                  down sucessfully. See below for details.
- SSL_FAILURE 1
  This notification is sent if the SSL connection could not be established or if an existing 
  connection failed. Valid values for param2 are:
  - SSL_FAILURE_UNKNOWN 0 - Details may have been sent with a SSL_VERBOSE_* notification.
  - SSL_FAILURE_ESTABLISH 1 - Problem during SSL negotiation
  - SSL_FAILURE_LOADDLLS 2
  - SSL_FAILURE_INITSSL 4
  - SSL_FAILURE_VERIFYCERT 8 - The remote SSL certificate was invalid
- SSL_VERBOSE_WARNING 3
  SSL_VERBOSE_INFO 4
  This two notifications contain some additional information. The value given by param2 is a 
  pointer to a null-terminated char string (char *) with some useful information.
- SSL_VERIFY_CERT 2
  This notification is sent each time a remote certificate has to be verified.
  param2 is a pointer to a t_SslCertData structure which contains some information
  about the remote certificate.
  Return 1 if you trust the certificate and 0 if you don't trust it. If you're unsure so that the
  user has to choose to trust the certificate return 2.
  In this case, you have to call SetNotifyReply later to resume the SSL connection. nID has to be
  the priv_data element of the t_SslCertData structure and nCode has to be SSL_VERIFY_CERT.
  Set nAction to 1 if you trust the certificate and 0 if you don't trust it.

Be careful with closing the connection after sending data, not all data may have been sent already.
Before closing the connection, you should call Shutdown() and wait for the SSL_INFO_SHUTDOWNCOMPLETE
notification. This assures that all encrypted data really has been sent.
